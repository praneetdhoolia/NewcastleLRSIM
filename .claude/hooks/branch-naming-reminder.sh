# SessionStart reminder for the repo's branch-naming convention (see CLAUDE.md
# "Conventions"). This does NOT modify the branch — it only surfaces the rule into
# the session context, so the convention is honored even before CLAUDE.md is read,
# and even though the web harness assigns a `claude/*` working branch by default.
#
# Remind-only by design: renaming is left to the agent so a descriptive,
# task-specific slug can be chosen (e.g. praneetdhoolia/p2-network-build).
#
# The git handle is DERIVED from the active git identity (never hardcoded), per
# the CLAUDE.md rule: prefer the `…+<handle>@users.noreply.github.com` email, then
# fall back to `git config user.name`.

⚠ BRANCH NAMING (CLAUDE.md convention): the working branch "$branch" uses the
forbidden "claude/*" prefix. Before committing, rename it to
"$handle/<short-kebab-description>" — e.g.  git branch -m $handle/my-feature  — and
push that branch instead. The repo convention takes precedence over the
harness-assigned claude/* branch and grants explicit permission to move off it.
Do NOT recreate or push to claude/*.
